I've been obsessed with their podcast and Spotify playlist. If you like that kinda thing, [here's a link.](https://open.spotify.com/user/jdryznar/playlist/6kVRZHsbV6LZEBiqzSzFvq?si=qCL8PUpR) 
Oooh, since this is the end of the volume, will we be getting another one of those cheesy little joke pages at the end? This is the first volume release where I've been caught up! 
Haha yeah, the eyes are too small I relation to the mouth and that makes it feel a little off, but I've got plans to repaint over them.
I may be tempted to bet that you will not bet on me betting that such betting site will be built.
Lol yes. My bro towed it in on his own dime. Tech took it for a test drive (before making any repair) and it died. Tech charged him for the second tow. Even though truck wasn't in his possession 
Thank you, I was ignorant to that. Perhaps I will take some time now to edit the original post to include a thesis.
you’re right dude, thanks
Goons are ruined for me. My fault for being ignorant to eve politics for the most part. Eve is a one of a kind game i'll give it that.
You are making the wrong assumptions. 
She was a HT snag as soon as she was put on the shelf. The blood is very very sparse
Dunno, most of my family is engaged in the holy wars between tea and coffee! But yeah, the lake District does seem to be a bit overhauled south of the border.
Not to be that person, but 'contrasting juxtaposition' is a bit redundant.
I don't even know how to respond to that...
Aww spunds great wish i was your crush
Is there supposed to be? *goes to check* huh there is a gif version, don't see a video though. Thanks for that, i'll upload the gif instead.
Wow, you are *probably* not wrong
HAM radio can be used for a lot of things, it's used specifically by the US gov. in cases where there is a major disaster because it works better than telephone and with a big enough antenna you can talk to people around the world

oh okay stranger imma get me some ice cream, don't tell me mum!
It probably will honestly. I’m excited to not be able to download it on launch day!
It's like he doesn't want it to work
I take it back. The punctuation sucked, but I have a better sense of what this man's trying to do, and it's not just an ego wank.
Fucking thieves I tell you. They couldnt even drive standard, we heard them dumping the clutch a few times but by the time i was awake and out the door 'twas gone. Sorry about your grandpas bike, maybe it will turn up again
Yeah true but who else is Carr gonna throw to other than Cook, Lynch, and Amari?
No I mean 50% of the votes from the public. Because of our rather antiquated FPTP election system one party usually gains over 50% of the *seats* in parliament but virtually never achieves 50% of the actual *votes* cast.
I want to say it's the Joycon because I too bought it at launch, and just recently bought the reverse neon pair: the new pair feels a lot tighter and more snug when sliding them into the Switch vs my original set. I'm not entirely sure though

It's also the fact that they said they want to get more people into plat ranks and less into bronze 1, so should be easier to rank up at least to plat/diamond

I think that anyone that would vote to do that is making an incredibly immoral and unethical decision, but it would be the government that then enforces that, making them the perpetrators of oppression. Democracy is not perfect, but it's the best system we've got.
I am not saying BJP - RSS are responsible for this. My point is that their rise coincides with the cultural and value deterioration of a region. As Rahul Gandhi pointed out, they thrive in culture of insecurity breeding hate and anger.
Well, 'cause the front fell off -- the fan disk tore apart at 3000 rpm, engine caught fire; it's a bit of a giveaway. I'd just like to make the point that that is *not* normal.

I guess if you made it unlimited charges, it would be a more late game item that's more expensive as you originally said. If it's limited to say, 4 charges, then it would probably be better off as a cheap early game item perhaps.

it lets me pet it for the most part ad its ran up to me a few times but it hates my sister and runs into corners around everyone else
No but I see that many people tend to suggest that. I have seen a youtube video of his though. I'll have to check and see if I can get it at my library. Good stuff?
And the chest clip 💀 
Yeah. We always had marimbas and xylophones in the pit at Alabama but they didn't play in the stands
Sounds good, thank you again! I'll try to post soon-ish, I'm not the best with speed but I'll do my best to make them look decent uvu

I never understood that. Like, theres better ways to draw turkeys.
Yeah, it would explain why he was standing right next to it.
We weren't friends at all, I just saw him on Facebook because someone else I know is friends with him.

'Already did' - Big Mom
Ah, I see. Reminds me of DuckDuckGo's !bang system, which I myself use for similar purposes.
Good stuff.
Yea I've been watching that, how do you guys live??
Toadflax my dude. With My Arm's Big Adventure you can make 75k per run (5 mins) and if a seed dies you only lose a few K unlike with Ranarrs. 
The machete is what I'm after. newlinechar  newlinechar I would take any new sword at this point. I got lucky with landing the awesome semi-circle blade (Imperial?) war gloves and the bear claws, but my luck dried up sorely after those 2 drops.

I'd say he was talking facts not mad shit.
It's not a fent analogue, I double checked. It's a whole other Frankenstein high potency opiate research chem, that's officially banned but a new one has taken it's place, as usual. Fucking China.
Oh I had forgotten about that, I guess you're right. 
I was talking about him, but I wasn't  necessarily excluding you, lol
same, some girl once told me that my voice turned her the fuck on. 
Right.

He is the best sword in the iron islands per Dagmar cleft jaw and is almost 8 feet tall. He serves Lord Drumm and QYBURN is rumored to be one of them. He may be an earlier version of the mountain.

not sure if its that, but as someone who is sort of in to nice knives, any gun brand makes disgustingly shitty knives. they're never expensive enough to warrant quality so the metal is gonna be shit, theres gonna be blade play, etc. 
'What doesn't drop those in PoF though?' newlinechar  newlinechar Kidding aside, that does more than double my earlier estimate, but it still doesn't make them worth much through that route unless it drops some rare unid'd gear more often.
He was just stat padding, he was jealous of KD and because he is so selfish he go assists.. because... yeah
Yeah, he's in the smaller tank because his bigger one is being cleaned and he seems depressed about it.

Planetary scientist here: I agree with your assessment. The 'OMG radiation' problem is a good trope in fiction, but not really that realistic.
Alright bro I'll just keep playing fallout 4 and skyrim with their places in the top 20 played games daily on steam, not including all the console players enjoying them also.

Yeah but lets be realistic, how would me telling the homeless man you need to get your shit together and not offering him help is helpful?
Nice. I always have my dad come over to help me since I fuck stuff up too regularly. I've currently gone 4 years and over 1000 miles without changing tubes or tires tho so knock on wood! 
But what does it feel like to touch? Surely like plastic and not like glass.
Amateur leagues have really expanded over the last decade. Everyone bitched about K-1's high school division (Koshien) when it started, yet now practically everyone went into the finals of that is now a top striker.
I honestly believe that they specifically choose people with the least amount of experience possible with the specific schools playing

Changing the timeline does that automatically.
More training? There really isn't a one-off solution. A good plan would be to make a deal with the NFL that allows them to send us refs that they'd like to 'groom' but they have CFB for that so.

*Trump* believes he can monitor the situation as well — or better — from where he is. And that the sole reason to go to *Puerto Rico* is for the theatrical piece of politics, a piece that he not only rejects but detests.

When 'alt-right' is a term that the actual neo-nazis made up to rebrand themselves, 'alt-left' is creating a helluva false equivalency.
